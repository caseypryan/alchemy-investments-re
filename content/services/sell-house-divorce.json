      "html": "<p>Nevada is a <strong>community property state</strong>, which means that in most cases, assets acquired during the marriage—including your home—are owned equally by both spouses. When you divorce in Nevada, the family home is typically considered community property and must be divided fairly between both parties.</p><p>There are several ways divorcing couples can handle the marital home:</p><ul><li><strong>Sell and split the proceeds</strong> – The most common solution, especially when neither spouse can afford to buy out the other</li><li><strong>One spouse buys out the other</strong> – Requires refinancing and the ability to qualify for a new mortgage</li><li><strong>Deferred sale</strong> – Less common, usually when minor children are involved and one parent stays in the home temporarily</li><li><strong>Continue co-owning</strong> – Rarely recommended due to ongoing financial ties and potential conflicts</li></ul><p>For most divorcing couples in Las Vegas, selling the home and splitting the proceeds is the cleanest break.

      "heading": "Common Divorce Home Sale Scenarios We Handle",
      "html": "<p>We've worked with hundreds of divorcing couples in Las Vegas, and we understand that every situation is unique. Here are some common scenarios we handle:</p><h3>One Spouse Wants to Sell, the Other Doesn't</h3><p>This is one of the most common conflicts. If the divorce decree orders the sale of the home, we can help facilitate that sale quickly. Even if one spouse is reluctant, a fair cash offer and quick closing can help both parties move forward.</p><h3>Neither Spouse Can Afford the House Alone</h3><p>After divorce, many people find they can't qualify for a mortgage on their own or can't afford the payments without dual incomes. Selling to us for cash eliminates the need for either spouse to refinance or take on the burden alone.</p><h3>The House Needs Repairs You Can't Afford</h3><p>When you're already dealing with legal fees and the cost of establishing separate households, major home repairs are often impossible. We buy houses as-is, so neither spouse has to invest more money into the property.</p><h3>You Need to Sell Before a Court Deadline</h3><p>Divorce decrees sometimes include deadlines for selling property and dividing assets. Traditional real estate sales can take 60-90 days or longer, risking contempt of court. We can close in as little as 7 days to meet your deadline.</p><h3>You're Behind on Mortgage Payments</h3><p>Financial strain during divorce can lead to missed mortgage payments. If you're at risk of foreclosure, selling quickly for cash can help you avoid that damage to both credit scores and split whatever equity remains.</p><h3>You Want a Clean Break</h3><p>Some couples simply want to close this chapter as quickly as possible. Selling for cash allows both parties to receive their share immediately and move on without the stress of a prolonged traditional sale.</p>"

      "html": "<p>While some divorcing couples attempt to sell through a traditional real estate agent, this approach often creates more problems than it solves:</p><ul><li><strong>Extended timeline</strong> – Traditional sales average 60-90 days, prolonging the emotional stress and keeping you financially tied together</li><li><strong>Requires cooperation</strong> – Both spouses must agree on listing price, repairs, showings, and offers. Each decision becomes a potential point of conflict</li><li><strong>Showing difficulties</strong> – One or both spouses may still be living in the home, making showings awkward and complicated</li><li><strong>Repair disputes</strong> – Who pays for repairs or improvements? Negotiations can reignite conflicts</li><li><strong>Deal contingencies</strong> – Traditional buyers often back out due to financing, inspections, or appraisal issues</li><li><strong>Hidden costs</strong> – Agent commissions (5-6%), closing costs, and repairs can significantly reduce what you split</li><li><strong>Ongoing expenses</strong> – While the house sits on the market, both parties are responsible for mortgage, insurance, utilities, and maintenance</li></ul><p>Cash sales eliminate all of these problems. You get one offer, make one decision together, and close quickly with no repairs or additional costs.</p>"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you buy our house if only one spouse wants to sell?",
      "answer": "In most cases, both spouses must agree to the sale if both names are on the title. However, if your divorce decree orders the sale of the home, we can proceed even if one party is reluctant. We recommend consulting with your attorney about your specific situation. We're happy to work with your legal team to facilitate the sale according to court orders."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle equity division between spouses?",
      "answer": "We work directly with your attorneys and the title company to ensure proceeds are divided exactly according to your divorce settlement or decree. At closing, the title company will distribute funds according to the instructions provided by your legal representatives. This can be a 50/50 split, or any other division specified in your agreement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we owe more than the house is worth?",
      "answer": "If you're underwater on your mortgage (owe more than the home's current value), we can potentially work with your lender to negotiate a short sale. In a short sale, the lender agrees to accept less than the full loan balance. We have experience handling short sales and can work through this process with both spouses and your lender."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we sell before the divorce is finalized?",
      "answer": "Yes. Many couples choose to sell their home before the divorce is finalized to simplify the asset division process. As long as both spouses agree to the sale and the terms, we can proceed. This often makes the divorce proceedings smoother since the major asset has already been liquidated and divided."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we can't agree on the offer price?",
      "answer": "We provide a clear, data-backed cash offer based on current market conditions, comparable sales, and the property's condition. If you're having trouble reaching an agreement, you can share our offer with your respective attorneys or mediators. Having a firm cash offer often makes negotiations easier than dealing with hypothetical listing prices and uncertain outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do we both need to be present at closing?",
      "answer": "Typically, yes, both spouses need to sign the closing documents if both are on the title. However, if one spouse cannot attend in person, arrangements can be made for remote signing or power of attorney. We work with your title company and attorneys to accommodate your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documents do we need to sell during divorce?",
      "answer": "You'll need the property deed, mortgage information, property tax records, and a copy of your divorce decree or settlement agreement (if finalized). If the divorce isn't finalized, we'll need documentation showing both parties agree to the sale. Your attorney can advise on any additional documentation specific to your case."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I have to pay any fees or commissions?",
      "answer": "No! Unlike selling with a real estate agent (which typically costs 6% in commissions), there are no fees, commissions, or closing costs when you sell to us. The cash offer we make is the amount you'll receive at closing, which you'll then divide according to your agreement. This transparency makes asset division much simpler."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you close on our house?",
      "answer": "We can close in as little as 7-14 days once both parties agree to our offer. If you have a court-ordered deadline to sell the property, let us know and we'll work to accommodate that timeline. We understand that timing can be critical in divorce situations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if one of us is living in the house?",
      "answer": "That's not a problem. We understand that one or both spouses may still be living in the home during the divorce process. We'll work around your situation and can be flexible with move-out dates. You don't need to move out until after closing, and we can coordinate a closing date that gives you adequate time to find new housing."
