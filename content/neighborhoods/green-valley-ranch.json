      "question": "How do you determine your offer price?",
      "answer": "We evaluate your Green Valley Ranch property based on its location, size, condition, and recent comparable sales in your neighborhood. Our goal is to make a fair offer that reflects the current market while factoring in any repairs or updates needed."

      "question": "Will I have to pay any fees or commissions?",
