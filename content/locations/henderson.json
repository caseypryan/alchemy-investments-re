    {
      "question": "How quickly can you buy my Henderson house?",
      "answer": "We can close in as little as 7 days, though we're flexible with your timeline. Some sellers need to close immediately, while others prefer to wait a few weeks or even months. You choose the closing date that works best for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you really buy houses in any condition?",
      "answer": "Yes! We buy houses in Henderson in any condition—from move-in ready homes to properties that need significant repairs. Whether your home has foundation issues, needs a new roof, has outdated interiors, or has fire or water damage, we'll make you a fair cash offer."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you determine your offer price?",
      "answer": "We evaluate your Henderson property based on its location, size, condition, and recent comparable sales in your neighborhood. Our goal is to make a fair offer that reflects the current market while factoring in any repairs or updates needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I have to pay any fees or commissions?",
      "answer": "No! Unlike selling with a real estate agent (which typically costs 6% in commissions), there are no fees, commissions, or closing costs when you sell to us. The cash offer we make is the amount you'll receive at closing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What areas of Henderson do you buy in?",
      "answer": "We buy houses throughout all of Henderson, including Green Valley, Green Valley Ranch, Anthem, Lake Las Vegas, Seven Hills, Inspirada, Cadence, MacDonald Ranch, and all other Henderson neighborhoods and subdivisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you buy my house if I'm behind on payments?",
      "answer": "Yes. If you're facing foreclosure or are behind on mortgage payments, we may be able to help. Contact us immediately to discuss your situation, and we'll explore options to help you avoid foreclosure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to clean or repair anything before selling?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. We buy houses as-is, which means you don't need to clean, make repairs, or do any prep work. We handle everything after the purchase."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there any obligation when I request a cash offer?",
      "answer": "None at all. Our cash offer is completely free and comes with no obligation. If our offer doesn't work for you, no problem. There's no pressure to accept."
