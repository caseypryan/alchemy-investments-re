    {
      "question": "How fast can you really buy my house?",
      "answer": "We can close in as little as 7-14 days if you choose our cash offer option. The timeline is flexible—if you need more time, we can accommodate that too. Unlike traditional sales that take 30-60+ days, our streamlined process moves quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I have to make repairs before selling?",
      "answer": "No! We buy houses as-is in ANY condition. Whether your home needs minor cosmetic work or major repairs, we'll make you a fair cash offer without requiring any fixes. You can sell your house exactly as it is today."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between your cash offer and working with an agent?",
      "answer": "Our cash offer option is faster (7-14 days vs 30-60+ days), requires no repairs, and has no agent fees. Working with one of our top agents typically nets a higher sale price but takes longer and may require some prep work. We'll help you understand both options and choose what's best for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any fees or commissions?",
      "answer": "With our cash offer option, there are NO fees, commissions, or closing costs. If you work with one of our agents, standard real estate commissions apply (typically 5-6%), but our agents' expertise often results in higher sale prices that more than offset the commission."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of houses do you buy in Las Vegas?",
      "answer": "We buy all types of properties in the Las Vegas Valley: single-family homes, condos, townhomes, multi-family properties, and even land. We buy in any condition—from move-in ready to completely distressed. Location doesn't matter: Henderson, Summerlin, North Las Vegas, downtown—we cover the entire valley."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you determine your cash offer?",
      "answer": "We analyze recent comparable sales in your neighborhood, assess your property's condition, and factor in current market conditions. Our goal is to make you a fair offer that reflects true market value while accounting for the speed and convenience we provide."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Alchemy Investments RE a licensed company?",
      "answer": "Yes! We are a fully licensed Nevada real estate brokerage (License #S.0184768) with over 10 years of experience in the Las Vegas market. We operate professionally, transparently, and ethically in every transaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you buy houses in Henderson, Summerlin, and other Las Vegas areas?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We buy houses throughout the entire Las Vegas Valley, including Henderson, Summerlin, North Las Vegas, Boulder City, downtown Las Vegas, and all surrounding neighborhoods. If it's in the Vegas metro area, we're interested."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm behind on payments or facing foreclosure?",
      "answer": "We can help! We've worked with many homeowners in difficult financial situations. Our quick closing timeline (7-14 days) can help you avoid foreclosure and protect your credit. Contact us immediately if you're facing foreclosure—the sooner we talk, the more options you'll have."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I sell if I have tenants in the property?",
      "answer": "Yes! We buy tenant-occupied properties all the time. You don't need to evict your tenants or wait for them to leave. We can work around the existing tenancy or take over the lease—whatever works best for your situation."
