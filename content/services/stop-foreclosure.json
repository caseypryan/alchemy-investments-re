We can typically close in 7-14 days—often before your scheduled auction date.

However, the sooner you contact us, the more options we have to help you.</p>"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How late in the foreclosure process can you help?",
      "answer": "We can help at any stage of foreclosure, but the earlier you contact us, the more options we have. Ideally, contact us as soon as you receive a Notice of Default or even before if you know you're going to have trouble making payments. We've even helped homeowners just days before their scheduled auction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I still owe money after you buy my house?",
      "answer": "No. When we buy your house, we pay off your mortgage in full. If you have equity in the property (the home is worth more than you owe), we'll give you the difference in cash. If you owe more than the home is worth, we'll work with your lender on a short sale, and you won't owe anything after closing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I owe more than my house is worth?",
      "answer": "This is called being \"underwater\" on your mortgage. In this situation, we can work with your lender to negotiate a short sale, where they agree to accept less than the full loan balance. We handle all negotiations with the lender on your behalf."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will selling to you hurt my credit?",
      "answer": "Selling your home before foreclosure is much better for your credit than letting it go to auction. While being behind on payments will impact your credit, a foreclosure causes much more severe and long-lasting damage. Selling to us stops the foreclosure and prevents that damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I have to pay you anything?",
      "answer": "No. We don't charge any fees, commissions, or closing costs. We handle everything and you receive the full cash offer amount (minus what's needed to pay off your mortgage)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I already received a foreclosure notice?",
      "answer": "Don't panic—contact us immediately. As long as the auction hasn't happened yet, we may be able to help. We'll evaluate your situation and let you know if we can stop the foreclosure by purchasing your home."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help if I have a second mortgage or liens on the property?",
      "answer": "Yes, we can work with multiple liens and mortgages. We'll need to know about all debts secured by the property, and we'll work to resolve them as part of the purchase."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documents do I need?",
      "answer": "We'll need information about your mortgage (loan balance, lender info), a copy of your foreclosure notice if you've received one, and basic information about your property. We'll guide you through exactly what we need."
