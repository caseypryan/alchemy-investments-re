The roof leaks, the HVAC doesn't cool properly in the desert heat, the kitchen is decades out of date, or there's foundation damage. You know that fixing everything would cost tens of thousands of dollars, but you can't afford the repairs, don't have time to manage contractors, or simply don't want to invest more money into a house you're selling.\n\nAt Alchemy Investments RE, we specialize in buying fixer-upper properties in Las Vegas exactly as they are. We're not traditional home buyers looking for move-in ready properties. We're real estate investors who purchase houses in any condition—from minor cosmetic issues to major structural problems.

      "heading": "Common Fixer-Upper Issues We Handle",
      "html": "<h3>Major Structural Issues</h3><p>Foundation problems, cracked slabs, settling issues—these are expensive repairs that can cost $15,000-$50,000 or more. In Las Vegas, foundation issues often stem from soil conditions, poor drainage, or shifting. Traditional buyers either won't touch these properties or will demand huge repair credits that make deals fall apart.</p><p>We purchase properties with foundation issues regularly. We have contractors who specialize in foundation work and understand the true cost of repairs. We'll make you a fair offer that accounts for the work needed.</p><h3>Roof Damage or Failure</h3><p>Las Vegas sun is brutal on roofs. If your roof is beyond its lifespan, has leak damage, or needs complete replacement, you're looking at $8,000-$20,000+ depending on the home's size and roofing material. Most lenders won't approve financing on properties with significant roof damage, making traditional sales nearly impossible.</p><p>We buy homes needing new roofs all the time. You don't need to replace the roof or even get repair estimates. We assess the roof condition and factor replacement costs into our offer.</p><h3>HVAC System Failure</h3><p>In Las Vegas, a functioning AC system isn't a luxury—it's essential. If your HVAC system is broken, outdated, or inefficient, replacement costs typically run $5,000-$12,000. Without working air conditioning, your home won't pass FHA or VA inspections, eliminating most traditional buyers.</p><p>We buy homes with broken or missing HVAC systems. We understand that replacing expensive systems before selling doesn't make financial sense for most sellers.</p><h3>Outdated Kitchens and Bathrooms</h3><p>Your kitchen has laminate countertops from the 1990s, old appliances, and worn cabinets. The bathrooms have dated fixtures and tired tile. A full kitchen remodel costs $20,000-$50,000, and bathroom updates run $5,000-$15,000 each. These updates are what most sellers think they need to do before listing.</p><p>You don't. We buy houses with outdated interiors constantly. We handle cosmetic renovations after closing. You save the time, money, and stress of remodeling.</p><h3>Plumbing and Electrical Problems</h3><p>Old galvanized pipes, polybutylene plumbing, outdated electrical panels, knob-and-tube wiring—these issues are common in older Las Vegas homes and can be expensive to update. Plumbing re-pipes cost $4,000-$12,000, and electrical panel upgrades run $1,500-$4,000. These aren't just expensive—they're also disruptive and time-consuming.</p><p>We purchase homes needing plumbing and electrical work regularly. These are exactly the types of properties we look for.</p><h3>Water Damage, Mold, or Fire Damage</h3><p>Properties with water damage, mold issues, or fire damage are extremely difficult to sell traditionally. Most buyers won't consider them, and lenders often won't finance them. Remediation and repairs can be extensive and expensive, sometimes exceeding $50,000 for severe damage.</p><p>We have experience with damaged properties. Whether it's water damage from leaks, mold remediation needs, or fire restoration, we can evaluate the damage and make an appropriate offer. These properties are our specialty.</p><h3>Code Violations and Unpermitted Work</h3><p>The previous owner did unpermitted additions or remodeling. Now you're selling and discovered code violations that need to be corrected. Bringing unpermitted work up to code can be expensive and complicated, requiring permits, inspections, and potentially undoing work that was done incorrectly.</p><p>We can work with properties that have code violations or unpermitted work. Depending on the situation, we may bring it up to code, legalize the unpermitted work, or factor removal into our plans.</p>"

      "heading": "The True Cost of Fixing Up Before Selling",
      "html": "<p>Many Las Vegas homeowners consider fixing up their property before selling, thinking they'll get a much higher price. However, this approach often doesn't make financial sense:</p><h3>High Renovation Costs</h3><p>Renovation costs in Las Vegas are substantial. A basic cosmetic remodel (paint, flooring, fixtures) runs $15,000-$30,000. Add in kitchen and bathrooms and you're at $40,000-$80,000. Major repairs like roof, HVAC, or foundation? Add another $20,000-$50,000. For a fixer-upper needing comprehensive work, total costs easily exceed $100,000.</p><h3>You Won't Get Dollar-for-Dollar Return</h3><p>Real estate studies consistently show that you don't get back every dollar you invest in renovations. Kitchen remodels typically return 60-70% of cost. Bathroom remodels return 60-65%. Major systems like HVAC or roofs return even less because they're expected to be functional—buyers don't pay premiums for new systems.</p><h3>Holding Costs During Renovation</h3><p>While you're renovating for 3-6 months, you're paying mortgage, insurance, property taxes, and utilities. In Las Vegas, these holding costs typically run $1,500-$3,000+ per month. Over a 6-month renovation period, that's $9,000-$18,000 in additional costs that reduce your net proceeds.</p><h3>Time and Stress</h3><p>Managing a renovation is a part-time job. You'll coordinate contractors, handle permits, make hundreds of decisions about finishes, and deal with unexpected problems that always arise. For most homeowners, especially those who are elderly, relocated, dealing with life changes, or simply busy, this time and stress isn't worth it.</p><h3>The Math Often Favors Selling As-Is</h3><p>Let's look at an example: Your fixer-upper is worth $350,000 if fully renovated. Renovations will cost $75,000. You'll spend $12,000 in holding costs during 6 months of work. That's $87,000 in costs for a house now worth $350,000—leaving you with $263,000.</p><p>If you sell as-is to us for $250,000, you close in 2 weeks with zero renovation costs, zero holding costs, zero stress. The difference? $13,000—hardly worth six months of work, $87,000 in upfront costs, and massive stress. This math is why many sellers choose to sell as-is.</p>"

      "heading": "Why Traditional Sales Don't Work for Fixer-Uppers",
      "html": "<p>Selling a fixer-upper through traditional real estate methods presents numerous challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Financing obstacles</strong> – Most buyers use FHA, VA, or conventional financing. These loans require properties to meet minimum property standards. Homes with roof damage, HVAC issues, foundation problems, or other defects often won't qualify, eliminating 80-90% of potential buyers.</li><li><strong>Inspection issues</strong> – Even if you find a buyer, their home inspection will identify every problem. They'll request repair credits, ask you to fix issues, or walk away entirely. Each buyer who backs out means more months on the market.</li><li><strong>Low appraisals</strong> – Properties needing significant work often don't appraise for listing price. When appraisals come in low, buyers can't get financing for the agreed amount, and deals fall through.</li><li><strong>Extended market time</strong> – Fixer-uppers sit on the market much longer than move-in ready homes. In Las Vegas, while a updated home might sell in 30 days, a fixer-upper can take 90-180 days or more to find the right cash buyer or investor.</li><li><strong>Limited buyer pool</strong> – You're limited to either cash investors or buyers with renovation loans (203k or HomeStyle). These buyers are scarce and they're sophisticated—they know they're getting a discount because of the limited market.</li><li><strong>Continued holding costs</strong> – Every month your fixer-upper sits on the market, you're paying mortgage, insurance, taxes, and utilities on a house you can't comfortably live in. These costs add up fast.</li><li><strong>Property deterioration</strong> – Properties with existing issues often deteriorate further while on the market. A small roof leak becomes major water damage. A cracked foundation gets worse. This hurts your value over time.</li></ul><p>Selling directly to a cash buyer who specializes in fixer-uppers eliminates all these problems. We're specifically looking for properties other buyers don't want.</p>"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What condition of properties do you actually buy?",
      "answer": "We buy houses in any condition. This includes properties with foundation issues, roof damage, plumbing or electrical problems, fire or water damage, mold, outdated systems, cosmetic issues, code violations, or any combination of these. We've purchased everything from homes needing minor updates to properties requiring complete gut renovations. If you own it, we can buy it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you determine your offer for a fixer-upper?",
      "answer": "We evaluate your property based on its location, size, and current condition. We estimate the cost to bring it to market standards (repairs, renovations, permits) and factor that into our offer along with our holding costs and business profit margin. Our goal is to make you a fair offer that reflects the as-is value while saving you the time, money, and stress of repairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get estimates for repairs before contacting you?",
      "answer": "No, you don't need to get repair estimates. We have contractors and experience to estimate repair costs accurately. Just be honest about the property's condition and any issues you know about. We'll assess everything during our evaluation and make an appropriate offer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you lower your offer after inspecting the property?",
      "answer": "As long as you're upfront about the property's condition and we don't discover major undisclosed issues, our offer will remain consistent. We're experienced at evaluating properties and pricing in repair needs. Unlike traditional buyers who back out after inspections, we know what we're getting into."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I've started repairs but didn't finish?",
      "answer": "That's fine. We buy properties in mid-renovation all the time. Whether you started a kitchen remodel and ran out of money, began a bathroom update and couldn't finish, or have partially completed work throughout the house, we can take it as-is. Incomplete projects don't scare us off."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you buy my house if it has code violations?",
      "answer": "Yes. Code violations, unpermitted work, and other compliance issues are situations we handle regularly. Depending on the violations, we may bring the work up to code, legalize the unpermitted improvements, or factor removal into our renovation plans. Let us know about any violations upfront and we'll address them appropriately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you buy houses with foundation problems?",
      "answer": "Yes. Foundation issues are one of the most common major repairs we handle. Whether it's settling, cracks, drainage problems, or more serious structural issues, we have contractors who specialize in foundation work. We'll evaluate the foundation condition and make an offer that accounts for proper repairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "My house has mold. Will you still buy it?",
      "answer": "Yes. Mold is common in properties with water damage or humidity issues. We have mold remediation specialists who can assess the extent of the problem and perform proper remediation. We've purchased many properties with mold issues—it doesn't disqualify your home from our consideration."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you close on a fixer-upper?",
      "answer": "We typically close in 7-14 days once you accept our offer. The timeline may be slightly longer if there are title issues or if you need more time, but we're very flexible. Since we're paying cash and buying as-is, there are no financing delays or repair contingencies to slow things down."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I have to pay any fees or commissions?",
      "answer": "No! Unlike selling with a real estate agent (which typically costs 6% in commissions), there are no fees, commissions, or closing costs when you sell to us. The cash offer we make is the amount you'll receive at closing. You also save all the money you would have spent on repairs."
