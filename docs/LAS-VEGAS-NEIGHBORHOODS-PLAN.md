# Las Vegas Neighborhoods Expansion Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for creating individual neighborhood pages across the Las Vegas Valley. Each neighborhood page will target hyper-local SEO keywords and provide valuable information about selling homes in specific areas.

## Strategy

### Content Approach
- **Individual neighborhood pages** at `/neighborhoods/[slug]`
- **1,500-2,000 words** of unique, localized content per page
- **Target long-tail keywords** like "sell house fast [neighborhood]"
- **Include local data**: median home prices, demographics, amenities, schools
- **Hyperlocal testimonials** from each neighborhood when possible
- **Internal linking** to parent location pages (Henderson, Las Vegas, Summerlin, Paradise)

### SEO Goals
- Capture hyper-local search traffic
- Rank for "[neighborhood name] + [service keyword]" combinations
- Build topical authority in Las Vegas real estate
- Support parent location pages with internal linking
