      "html": "<h3>Property Sitting Vacant</h3><p>Many probate properties sit vacant for 6-12 months during the probate process. This creates risks (vandalism, squatters, deterioration) and costs (insurance, utilities, property taxes). Selling quickly to a cash buyer minimizes these issues.</p><h3>Heirs Who Want Fast Distribution</h3><p>Beneficiaries are often eager to receive their inheritance. A traditional sale taking 90+ days prolongs the process. Our fast cash purchase helps executors distribute assets sooner.</p><h3>Multiple Heirs with Different Opinions</h3><p>When several people inherit, disagreements about selling price and repairs are common. A straightforward cash offer gives everyone a clear number to evaluate and eliminates disputes about renovation costs.</p><h3>Out-of-State Executors</h3><p>If you're managing a Las Vegas estate from another state, dealing with contractors, agents, and showings is nearly impossible. We handle everything and can accommodate remote closing.</p><h3>Properties Needing Major Repairs</h3><p>Many older probate properties need $50K+ in repairs to sell on the market. Using estate funds for renovations may not be the best use of heir assets. Selling as-is to a cash buyer preserves more value for distribution.</p>"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How long does a probate sale take in Nevada?",
      "answer": "From petition to closing, probate sales typically take 30-60 days in Nevada, depending on the court's schedule and whether any heirs object. Once the court approves the sale, we can close in as little as 7 days. The overall probate process usually takes 6-12 months, but the property sale portion can move quickly with a cash buyer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need court approval to sell the probate property?",
      "answer": "In most cases, yes. If the estate is going through general administration (formal probate), the executor must petition the court and get approval before selling real property. There are some exceptions for smaller estates or if the will gave the executor independent powers. Your probate attorney can advise on your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can heirs object to the sale?",
      "answer": "Yes, heirs have the right to be notified of the proposed sale and can file objections with the court. However, if you've obtained a fair market offer and the sale is in the estate's best interest, courts typically approve it. Having a clear cash offer at fair market value helps reduce heir objections."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the property needs repairs?",
      "answer": "You don't need to make repairs. We buy probate properties as-is. Making extensive repairs using estate funds may not be the best use of assets that should go to heirs. We factor the repair costs into our offer, and you avoid the time and expense of contractors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you determine the offer price?",
      "answer": "We base our offer on the property's location, size, condition, and recent comparable sales. For probate properties, we also consider deferred maintenance and vacancy issues. Our offer reflects current as-is market value, which is what most probate courts look for."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documents do you need for a probate sale?",
      "answer": "We'll need a copy of the death certificate, letters testamentary (court document appointing you as executor), property deed, and mortgage payoff information if applicable. Your probate attorney will handle the court petition paperwork. We'll provide a purchase agreement that your attorney can attach to the petition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you buy the property before probate is complete?",
      "answer": "We can make an offer at any point, but the actual sale must receive court approval during probate. We'll work with your timeline—if you're early in the probate process, we can provide an offer now and wait for court approval later."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the sale proceeds?",
      "answer": "Sale proceeds go to the estate. After paying off any mortgage, liens, and estate debts, the remaining funds are distributed to heirs according to the will (or Nevada intestacy law if there's no will). The executor manages this distribution with court oversight."
