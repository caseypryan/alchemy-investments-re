      "question": "Do you really buy houses in any condition?",
      "answer": "Yes! We buy houses in Anthem in any condition—from move-in ready homes to properties that need significant repairs. Whether your home has foundation issues, needs a new roof, has outdated interiors, or has fire or water damage, we'll make you a fair cash offer."

    {
      "question": "How do you determine your offer price?",
      "answer": "We evaluate your Anthem property based on its location, size, condition, and recent comparable sales in your neighborhood. Our goal is to make a fair offer that reflects the current market while factoring in any repairs or updates needed."

      "question": "Will I have to pay any fees or commissions?",
      "answer": "No! Unlike selling with a real estate agent (which typically costs 6% in commissions), there are no fees, commissions, or closing costs when you sell to us. The cash offer we make is the amount you'll receive at closing."
