      "content": "Being a landlord isn't for everyone. What once seemed like a good investment may have become a source of constant stress, especially if you're dealing with difficult tenants, endless maintenance calls, or managing the property from out of state. If you're ready to exit the landlord business and sell your Las Vegas rental property, you've come to the right place.\n\nAt Alchemy Investments RE, we specialize in buying rental properties with tenants in place. Whether your tenants are paying on time or you're dealing with non-payment issues, whether the property is in great shape or needs significant repairs, we can make you a fair cash offer. You don't need to wait for leases to expire, evict tenants, or coordinate showings around rental schedules. We handle occupied properties regularly.\n\nSelling a tenant-occupied property through traditional methods is extremely challenging. Most retail buyers want to move in themselves and won't consider properties with tenants. This means you'd need to either evict current tenants (a lengthy and costly process in Nevada) or wait months for leases to expire before listing. Cash investors like us eliminate these problems by purchasing the property in its current occupied state, allowing you to move on quickly."

      "html": "<h3>Tired of Being a Landlord</h3><p>You bought the property years ago thinking rental income would be passive, but it's been anything but. Between tenant turnover, maintenance emergencies, rent collection issues, and property management headaches, you're ready to exit. The property may be cash flowing, but the stress isn't worth it anymore.</p><p>We understand. Real estate investing sounds great in theory, but the reality of managing tenants—especially from afar—is exhausting. Selling to us means you can liquidate the asset without going through the months-long process of evicting tenants, making repairs, and staging for traditional buyers.</p><h3>Problem Tenants Who Won't Pay</h3><p>Your tenants have stopped paying rent, but Nevada's eviction process means you're stuck. Even with non-payment, evictions can take 30-60 days or longer, especially if tenants contest the proceedings. During that time, you're not collecting rent but still paying the mortgage, insurance, and property taxes.</p><p>We can buy your property even with non-paying tenants in place. You won't need to complete the eviction process yourself—we take over the property and the tenant situation. This gets you out of a money-losing situation immediately.</p><h3>Out-of-State Landlords</h3><p>You own a Las Vegas rental property but live in another state. Managing from afar through a property management company eats into your cash flow with their fees (typically 8-10% of monthly rent). When issues arise, you can't easily check on the property yourself. You're tired of the distance making everything more complicated and expensive.</p><p>Out-of-state landlords are some of our most common sellers. Selling to us is entirely remote—we handle the entire transaction without you needing to fly to Las Vegas. You can exit the landlord business from wherever you live.</p><h3>Inherited Rental Properties</h3><p>You inherited a rental property from a family member and never wanted to be a landlord in the first place. You may not know the tenants, understand the rental market, or have experience managing properties. The responsibility fell into your lap, and you'd rather liquidate and move on.</p><p>We work with many heirs who inherited rental properties. Selling the property quickly lets you convert the inheritance to cash without taking on the burden of becoming a landlord.</p><h3>Rental Property Needs Major Repairs</h3><p>The property needs significant repairs—roof replacement, HVAC updates, foundation work—but it's occupied. Coordinating major renovations with tenants living there is nearly impossible. You can't afford to buy them out of their lease and do the work while vacant, but you also can't sell in its current condition to traditional buyers.</p><p>We buy rental properties as-is, even with tenants and deferred maintenance. You don't invest another dollar into repairs. We handle renovations after closing, working around tenants or after lease expiration.</p>"

      "heading": "Understanding Nevada Landlord-Tenant Laws",
      "html": "<p>Nevada has specific laws governing rental properties and tenant rights that make selling occupied properties challenging through traditional methods:</p><h3>Lease Requirements and Rights</h3><p>In Nevada, valid leases typically survive property sales. This means if you sell to a traditional buyer, they must honor existing leases until expiration. Most retail buyers don't want this—they want to move in immediately. This creates a major barrier to selling occupied rental properties conventionally.</p><p>However, cash investors like us are comfortable purchasing occupied properties and honoring existing leases. If you have good tenants with valid leases, we can take over as the new landlord. If you have problem tenants, we have experience managing those situations post-closing.</p><h3>Nevada Eviction Process</h3><p>If you have non-paying or problematic tenants, Nevada eviction law requires specific steps:</p><ul><li><strong>5-Day Notice to Pay or Quit</strong> – For non-payment of rent</li><li><strong>5-Day Notice for Lease Violation</strong> – For other lease violations</li><li><strong>30-Day or No-Cause Notice</strong> – For month-to-month tenancies</li><li><strong>Unlawful Detainer Action</strong> – Formal eviction lawsuit if tenant doesn't comply</li><li><strong>Court Hearing</strong> – Typically 10-21 days after filing</li><li><strong>Lockout</strong> – Sheriff executes eviction after judgment</li></ul><p>The entire process typically takes 30-60 days minimum, and longer if tenants contest. During this time, you're usually not collecting rent but still paying all property expenses. Selling to us eliminates the need to complete this process yourself.</p><h3>Security Deposit Requirements</h3><p>Nevada law requires landlords to return security deposits within 30 days of lease termination, with itemized deductions for damages. When you sell a rental property, security deposit funds must transfer to the new owner. We handle this properly at closing, ensuring compliance with Nevada law and protecting you from liability.</p>"

      "heading": "Why Traditional Sales Don't Work for Rental Properties",
      "html": "<p>Most landlords initially consider listing their rental property with a real estate agent, but this approach creates significant challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Retail buyers want vacant properties</strong> – The vast majority of home buyers want to purchase a property they can move into. Occupied rental properties appeal to a much smaller pool of buyers, mostly investors. This limited buyer pool means longer market times and often lower offers.</li><li><strong>Difficult showings</strong> – Nevada law requires you to provide 24-hour notice before entering a rental unit. Coordinating showings around tenant schedules is a nightmare, and some tenants refuse to cooperate or actively sabotage showings.</li><li><strong>Property condition</strong> – Tenants often don't maintain properties like owners do. Traditional buyers will request repairs based on inspection results, but making repairs while tenants occupy the property is extremely difficult.</li><li><strong>Tenant rights</strong> – You must disclose tenant situations to potential buyers. Many buyers will walk away when they learn tenants come with the property, especially if there are any payment or conflict issues.</li><li><strong>Financing complications</strong> – Most traditional buyers use owner-occupied financing, which requires them to occupy the property. They can't get these favorable loan terms if tenants are in place, limiting your buyer pool to cash buyers or investors with more expensive investment financing.</li><li><strong>Time and uncertainty</strong> – The entire process typically takes 90-120 days or more for rental properties. During that time, you're still managing tenants, handling maintenance, and dealing with all landlord responsibilities.</li></ul><p>Selling to a cash investor specializing in rental properties bypasses all these problems. We're specifically looking for properties like yours, tenants and all.</p>"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you really buy my rental property with tenants still living there?",
      "answer": "Yes. We purchase occupied rental properties regularly. We can take over existing leases and become the new landlord, or we can handle tenant situations (including evictions if needed) after closing. You don't need to worry about removing tenants before selling."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my tenants aren't paying rent?",
      "answer": "We can still buy your property. Non-paying tenants are a common situation we handle. Once you sell to us, the tenant issue becomes ours to resolve. You're no longer responsible for collecting unpaid rent or completing the eviction process. This is one of the most common reasons landlords sell to us—they want out of a losing situation quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to tell my tenants I'm selling?",
      "answer": "It depends on your lease agreement and Nevada law. Generally, you should notify tenants of the sale, though you don't need their permission. We can advise on the proper notification process for your specific situation and can handle communications with tenants if needed. Many landlords prefer to notify tenants after accepting an offer and nearing closing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you determine the offer price for an occupied rental property?",
      "answer": "We evaluate the property based on its location, size, condition, rental income, and comparable sales in the area. We factor in the current occupancy status—whether tenants are paying, lease terms remaining, and any tenant-related issues. Our goal is to make a fair offer that accounts for the convenience of selling quickly without dealing with vacancy or repairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the security deposit?",
      "answer": "Security deposits transfer to us at closing as the new owner. We become responsible for holding those funds and returning them to tenants per Nevada law when leases end. This is handled through the title company at closing, and you're released from any security deposit liability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I sell if the property needs repairs but tenants are living there?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We buy rental properties as-is, regardless of condition. We understand that making major repairs while the property is occupied is impractical. We'll assess the property in its current condition and make our offer accordingly. You don't spend a dollar on repairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "I use a property management company. How does the sale work?",
      "answer": "You'll need to coordinate with your property management company to provide us with lease information, tenant payment history, and property details. At closing, the management agreement terminates, and we may choose to work with them or manage the property ourselves. We handle all coordination to make the transition smooth."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have multiple rental properties I want to sell?",
      "answer": "Even better. We can purchase multiple properties in a single transaction, which simplifies the entire process. Many landlords who decide to exit the rental business have multiple properties they want to liquidate together. We can evaluate your entire portfolio and make offers on all properties at once."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to close on a rental property?",
      "answer": "We typically close in 14-21 days for rental properties, slightly longer than owner-occupied homes. This allows time to review lease documents, verify tenant situations, and ensure proper handling of security deposits. If you need to close faster, we can often accommodate shorter timelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I have to pay any fees or commissions?",
      "answer": "No! Unlike selling with a real estate agent (which typically costs 6% in commissions), there are no fees, commissions, or closing costs when you sell to us. The cash offer we make is the amount you'll receive at closing. This is especially important for rental properties where margins may already be tight."
