# Service Pages Expansion Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for creating problem/solution-focused service pages that target specific homeowner situations and pain points. Each service page addresses a unique scenario where homeowners need to sell quickly for cash.

- **Address specific pain points** and how we solve them
- **Build trust** with detailed explanations of processes and timelines
- **Include relevant legal/financial information** (not as advice, but as education)

### SEO Goals
- Capture high-intent search traffic from people in specific situations
- Rank for "[situation] + sell house" combinations
- Build topical authority as problem-solvers
- Generate qualified leads from people actively seeking solutions

### Page Goals
