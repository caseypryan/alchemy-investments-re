      "html": "<h3>Out-of-State Heirs</h3><p>If you inherited a Las Vegas property but live in another state, managing that property from afar can be a nightmare. You're dealing with property maintenance, utilities, insurance, property taxes, and potential squatters or vandalism—all while trying to coordinate a sale from hundreds or thousands of miles away.</p><p>We make it simple. You don't need to fly to Las Vegas multiple times for inspections, repairs, or closings. We can handle the entire transaction remotely, including remote notarization if needed.</p><h3>Multiple Heirs with Different Opinions</h3><p>When siblings or multiple family members inherit a property together, disagreements are common. Some want to sell immediately, others want to keep it as a rental, and everyone has different opinions about listing price and repairs.</p><p>A cash offer simplifies everything. There's one clear number, one decision to make, and the proceeds can be divided exactly according to the will or Nevada intestacy laws. No arguments about how much to invest in repairs.</p><h3>Properties in Poor Condition</h3><p>Many inherited homes haven't been updated in decades. They may have foundation issues, outdated electrical, old plumbing, or simply be filled with decades of belongings. The cost to bring them to market-ready condition can easily exceed $50,000-$100,000.</p><p>We buy inherited houses as-is. You don't invest another dollar into a property you didn't choose to buy in the first place.</p><h3>Emotional Burden</h3><p>Selling a parent's or grandparent's home is emotionally difficult. The house holds memories, and sorting through belongings can be overwhelming. Some heirs feel guilty about selling.</p><p>We understand. We approach these situations with empathy and patience. There's no pressure, and we can work on your timeline as you process your loss.</p>"

      "html": "<p>When you inherit property in Nevada, the process typically involves probate—the legal process of transferring ownership from the deceased to the heirs.

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I sell an inherited house that's still in probate?",
      "answer": "Yes. If you're the executor or personal representative, you can sell the property during probate with court approval. We've completed many probate sales and can work with your probate attorney to ensure the sale complies with Nevada probate law and gets proper court approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if there are multiple heirs who can't agree?",
      "answer": "All heirs on the title must agree to sell the property. However, a clear cash offer often helps resolve disagreements since there's one firm number to evaluate rather than hypothetical listing prices. If the estate is in probate, the court may order the sale if heirs can't agree and it's in the estate's best interest."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to clean out the house before selling?",
      "answer": "No. We can buy the property with all contents inside. If there are items you want to keep or family heirlooms, take those first. Everything else can stay. We can handle the estate cleanout and disposal after closing."
    },
    {
      "question": "I live out of state. Can I still sell without coming to Las Vegas?",
      "answer": "Yes. We handle remote transactions regularly. We can evaluate the property, make an offer, and close the sale with you participating remotely. Remote notarization and power of attorney arrangements can eliminate the need for you to travel to Las Vegas."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the money divided among multiple heirs?",
      "answer": "At closing, the title company distributes proceeds according to the will or, if there's no will, according to Nevada intestacy laws. If heirs inherited equal shares, the money is split equally. We work with your attorney or the probate court to ensure proper distribution."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the house has a mortgage or liens?",
      "answer": "We can handle properties with existing mortgages, tax liens, or other debts. These are typically paid off at closing from the sale proceeds. If there's equity remaining after paying debts, that's what gets distributed to heirs. If the property is underwater, we may be able to negotiate a short sale with the lender."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you determine your offer for an inherited property?",
      "answer": "We evaluate the property based on its location, size, condition, and recent comparable sales in the neighborhood. For inherited properties that may be in poor condition or need extensive repairs, we factor those costs into our offer. Our goal is to provide a fair price that saves you the time and expense of repairs and traditional selling."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I owe taxes on the inherited property sale?",
      "answer": "Generally, inherited property receives a 'step-up in basis' to its fair market value at the time of the decedent's death. This means if you sell soon after inheriting, you likely won't owe capital gains taxes. However, we're not tax advisors—consult a CPA or tax attorney about your specific situation."
